Change History for BLOWFISH.EXE
===============================

Version    Date       Change
-------  --------   ---------------------------------------------------------
1.00     16-06-94   Initial release

1.10     17-06-94   Added key validation.  The key is tested for correctness,
                      and if it is wrong, decryption is not done.
                    Added buffering of I/O.

1.11     20-06-94   Fixed problem with source files shorter than header.

1.12     22-06-94   Minor performance improvement through fewer memcpy()'s

1.20     22-06-94   Added block chaining and double encryption, for much
                    greater security(!)

1.21     29-06-94   Performance tuning - improved speed by 90% (!)
                    - changed F() to use union instead of mask/shift
                    - unrolled loop in encrypt() / decrypt()
                    - Compiled with full optimisation
                    - Optimised for 486

1.22     30-06-94   Added progress meter (% complete)
                    Instead of storing key, store encrypted checksum of
                      double-encrypted key (!).

1.30     31-07-95   Added file replacement, if target not specified.
                    Also handle ctrl-break and terminate cleanly.

1.40     15-08-95   Added interactive mode - prompt for input, masked
                      password, if no/insufficient parameters passed.
                    Added more comprehensive help.

1.41     16-08-95   Create temporary file in same directory as target,
                      so rename problems eliminated.
                    Add error checking on file write, for disk full.

1.42     18-08-95   Split into BLOWFISH.EXE plus ENCRYPT.DLL.
                    Ship ENCRYPT.LIB, ENCRYPT.H so others can call it.
                    Also ship BF.EXE (statically-linked version).
                    Include SAMPLE.C, SAMPLE.EXE to show usage.

1.43     21-08-95   Handle data block lengths which are not a multiple of 8.

1.50     06-09-95   Implement new algorithm (as per DDJ Sept '95) - 15% faster!
                    Add test for sufficient free disk space for target file.
                    Maintain file date/time/attributes during encryption.
                    Use better block-chaining algorithm - another 15% faster.

1.51     27-09-95   Fixed stupid bug which generated invalid temporary filename
                      if the source file is in the root directory.

1.60á    06-01-97   Fixed minor weakness in block chaining algorithm.
                    Added and documented possible return codes from executable.
                    Added test for zero-length key.  Well spotted, Stefan!
                    Complete rewrite as C++ encryptor object, switch from
                      C-Set++ to VisualAge C++.
                    Add support for _System linkage calls to encryption
                      functions in DLL.  Thanks to Jeremy Mathers for this idea.
                    Added support for wildcard filenames - encrypt multiple
                      files, entire directories, etc.
                    Added optional file compression.
                    Added optional file overwrite (to DoD standards).
                    Optimised for Pentium processor.

1.60     03-03-97   Shipped correct encrypt.obj for static linking (D'OH!).
                    Added confirmation of key in interactive mode.
                    Fixed problem with opening the target when default taken
                      in interactve mode (if you ever struck this one, you
                      know what I'm talking about).
                    Fixed cosmetic problem with help text for codepages other
                      than 437.

1.61     22-07-97   Fixed cosmetic bug: incorrect percentage complete shown
                      when encrypting very large (30MB) files.  Thanks to Harry
                      Bush for finding this problem.
                    Fixed problem with generating target file name when source
                      file has no extension.  Good catch, Bakuteh.
                    Added -e and -d switches to force all files to be encrypted
                      or decrypted, respectively.
                    Added Windows NT/95 support (executable, static link only).

1.62     09-01-98   Implemented pseudo-random (time-stamp based) initialisation
                      of block chaining.
                    Published some previously undocumented functions to allow
                      programmers to better control block chaining functions.
                    Added compress/decompress to programming library.
                    Added check for decrypting files created with a later 
                      version.

1.63     13-01-98   Fixed backward compatibility problem with version 1.61: 
                      files decrypted incorrectly (first 8 bytes) with 1.62.  
                      Huge thanks to John Thompson for reporting this one.
